Description: Instructors can leverage `CrossR` to lead R users through high-
   intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise sessions. These sessions guide R 
   users through simple, hands-on coding activities repetitiously for 20-90 
   seconds at a time. The goal is to help R users become more fluent with the R 
   programming language and RStudio's shortcuts, while keeping things 
   challenging and fun.
