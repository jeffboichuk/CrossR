Description: Instructors can levarage `CrossR` to lead R Users through high-
   intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise sessions. These sessions guide R 
   Users through simple, hands-on coding activities repetitiously for 20-90 
   seconds at a time. The goal is to help R Users become more fluent with the R 
   programming language and RStudio's shortcuts, while keeping things 
   challenging and fun.
